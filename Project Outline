Region Map Simulation:

Add anything that you want, ask me if you are unsure if it would be okay to add

Objects:
  City(Terrain) - Large town, has higher population and more resources
  Town(terrain) - Low population and resources
  Mountains(Terrain) - blocks trade routes
  Water(Resource) - provides transportation and classified as resource
  Wood(Resource) -  Allows for expansion of cities and towns
  Metal(Resource) - Could have subclasses like Iron, Gold, Silber, etc.
  Currency - certain starting amount for region. The more resources in a region, the larger the starting balance is for the region
  
Map:
  3D
  Generate cities, towns, landscape, and resources randomly
  Generate size of map randomly

I/O:
  Windowed, adjustable
  2D Graphics
  Use Sprites if possible for symbols, ASCII if all else fails
  Will be simulation for now, if we have time left, we can create some user interaction to make it into somewhat of a game
  
  TODO:
    Create City object
    Modify Village object into a town object
    Create Water object
    Make map 3D instead of 2D
    
  Remember to commit your version to github after you complete a TODO task. If unsure what to do, ask. I am usually off of work on
  Tuesdays and Thursdays. I have classes in the morning everyday and don't work until 5 on the days that I do work and I usually 
  work till 12 a.m., but you can always text me, even during work
